# TinyStoriesGerman Dataset

This repository contains a German-translated version of the **[TinyStories dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/roneneldan/TinyStories)**.  
The original dataset was synthetically generated by GPT-3.5/GPT-4 and consists of short children's stories written with a small vocabulary.  
The translation was done automatically using the **Google Translate API**.
The dataset is available on Hugging Face Hub under **[fabi2347/TinyStoriesGerman](https://huggingface.co/datasets/fabi2347/TinyStoriesGerman)**.

## 📂 File structure

- `stories.jsonl`: Raw German translations.
- `stories.parquet`: Same data in a single parquet file.  
- `/data/train-*.parquet`: Auto-sharded parquet files (for dataset viewer / large-scale training).

## ⚙️ Translation notes

- Translations were performed automatically using the **Google Translate API**.  
- No manual post-editing was done, so some sentences may sound unnatural in German.  
- The dataset retains a similar structure as the original TinyStories dataset for compatibility.

You can load the dataset directly from Hugging Face Hub:

```python
from datasets import load_dataset
